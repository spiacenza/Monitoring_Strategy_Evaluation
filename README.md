# Monitoring_Strategy_Evaluation
Code for Monitoring Strategy Evaluation and associated experimental treatments
Each file corresponds to a different impact treatment (CB Cycle, Low and High Neritic Juvenile Impacts) and 
monitoring strategy treatment(random, age-biased, clutch frequency-biased). Code is for NetLogo 5.1.0. 
Newer versions of NetLogo may not work as well
The GUI indicates the based model settings. However, experiments were run by using BehaviorSpace using the GST SA_Detect for the 
BP Cycle treatment (with ["DetectA" -2.216764 -1.643709E-9 3.841832]; correspond to 10%,50% and 90%, respectively,
when converted from the log normalscale) and GST SA_Detect_FLowHigh (with ["DetectA" -2.216764 -1.643709E-9 3.841832]
["F" 2 10], which corresponds to 50% ad 10% harvest rate of juveniles/year).
